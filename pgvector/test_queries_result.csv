Measuring attitudes toward suicide and suicide prevention has been an endeavor
of many researchers in the ﬁeld of suicidology since the 1980s. Interventions aiming to
improve attitudes toward suicide prevention are common elements of multi-component
suicide preventive strategies [1,2] as the stigma surrounding suicide in the population could
be a perceived hindrance for preventing suicidal acts. Attitudes toward suicide also play an
important role in the willingness to implement suicide preventive interventions [3], as well
as in facilitating the acceptance and effect of these interventions. Furthermore, the stigma

Governments are also in a unique position to develop
and strengthen surveillance, resulting in better quality
and availability of both suicide and suicide attempt
data, and to provide and disseminate data that are
necessary to inform action (WHO, 2014a).
In countries where a fully developed, comprehen-
sive national strategy is not yet in place, this should
not delay implementing targeted suicide prevention
programmes since these can contribute to a national re-
sponse. Regardless of the current level of implemen-
tation, all LMICs can commence on strategic actions
for suicide prevention. Steps to engage stakeholders,
reduce access to means, build surveillance, raise aware-
ness, engage media, train health workers and change
attitudes can be started according to each context
(WHO, 2014a). Even if it is considered that a country

Even if people want to help, lay people are often hesitant
when confronting a person in a suicidal crisis, because of a
lack of knowledge and the fear, anger and anxiety that such
communication acts can awaken.19,41 A suicide communication
event can be a highly face-threatening situation, both for the
suicidal person and other people involved in the communication.20
The jokes and the ironic comments made by the participants, and
the fact that some did not take the TS’s posts seriously, could
partly be understood by the taboo and stigma that surround
suicide. Also, popular myths about suicide, such as ‘people who
talk about suicide don’t do it’ and ‘asking about suicidal thoughts
may create suicidal ideas’ may discourage lay intervention.20 This
could be a problem on internet forums like Flashback where many
participants are rather suspicious because of the high level of
deceptive posts and trolling. In this environment inaccurate","confess and seek contact on a subject that has always been
strongly taboo and therefore “belonged” to only a few voices
in public discourse. This opportunity has resulted in both
constructive and strongly destructive contributions, such as
pro-suicide messages.
Today, it seems a very important task for clinicians to respond
to the substantial amount of pro-suicide messages on the Internet
and to continue to develop preventive strategies and resources
for individuals at risk for suicidal acts [42]. The preventive
resources should also be developed using the dialogic
communication between the mental-health expertise and
help-seeking individuals; unidirectional information about
mental illness and suicide prevention is not enough [43].
Another important task is to raise awareness among clinicians
about the risks it may pose to suicidal individuals to visit
pro-suicide websites, which contain descriptions and evaluations
of potent suicide methods and promote an attitude that suicide","Life-Threatening Behavior, 46(5), 577–587. https://doi.org/10.1111/

Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide and 
accounts for 1.5% of all deaths in developed coun­
tries
[1]. Unfortunately, despite increased prevention 
efforts, suicide rates over the past several decades have 
remained high and thus the question of what causes a 
person to commit suicide, remains one of the central 
issues in psychiatry.
Suicide risk constitutes a complex set of intera­cting 
demographic, clinical, psychobiological and environ­
mental variables
[1-3]. T
o reduce death from suicide, the 
field needs to better understand the causes of suicide 
and suicide related behaviors and its correlates.
Suicidal behavior is a continuum with various terms 
incorporated in it, including deliberate self-harm, suicide 
attempts and eventually completed suicide. More­over

there is also diversity in suicide attempts, mainly 
between violent and nonviolent failed attempts. How­

qualitative–quantitative analysis of the messages posted during
and after the suicide. Nearly half the posted messages before
the suicide encouraged the victim to complete the suicidal act,
and a surprising number of posts after the suicide expressed
excitement, although around half of the posts considered the
suicide to be tragic. It is of great importance to increase
awareness of suicide signals and understanding about how
to respond to individuals who communicate suicide
intentions on different forums on the internet.

It is likely that these types of educational activities, not only increase the level of knowledge among
health-care professionals but also improve attitudes (especially when the negative attitudes stem from
a lack of knowledge about suicide prevention). The training of mental health professionals is, with a
few exceptions [9,12–14], usually performed in small groups or in settings that make it difﬁcult—not
to say impossible—to measure direct effects on suicidal behavior [8]. For this reason many studies
aiming to evaluate the effects of training in suicide prevention use other outcome measures, believed
to have an intermediary effect on suicidality. Measures relating to attitudes regarding whether suicide
is preventable, positive or negative views on working with suicidal patients, as well as professionals’
conﬁdence in their ability in working preventively are common. These outcome measures are based","in need and is a key way forward in suicide preven-

the process of consulting stakeholders about a national
response often generates interest and creates an en-
vironment for change. Through the process of creating
the national response, stakeholders become commit-
ted, public dialogue on stigma is encouraged, vulner-
able groups are identiﬁed, research priorities are
ﬁxed, and public and media awareness are increased
to ultimately reach the goal of reducing the suicide
rate in countries. Particularly in countries with limited
resources, the importance of communities and their
support of suicide prevention programmes cannot be
overstated (WHO, 2014a).

Measuring attitudes toward suicide and suicide prevention has been an endeavor
of many researchers in the ﬁeld of suicidology since the 1980s. Interventions aiming to
improve attitudes toward suicide prevention are common elements of multi-component
suicide preventive strategies [1,2] as the stigma surrounding suicide in the population could
be a perceived hindrance for preventing suicidal acts. Attitudes toward suicide also play an
important role in the willingness to implement suicide preventive interventions [3], as well
as in facilitating the acceptance and effect of these interventions. Furthermore, the stigma
surrounding suicide might inﬂuence the quality and effectiveness of care and, consequently,","Luxton DD, June JD, Comtois KA (2013). Can postdischarge

Reaching the global target reduction of the suicide
rate in countries
For national responses to be eﬀective, a comprehensive
multisectoral suicide prevention strategy, including
good-quality data, is essential (Vijayakumar et al.
2005). A national strategy indicates a government’s
clear commitment to dealing with the issue of suicide.
Typically, national strategies comprise a range of pre-
vention strategies, such as means restriction, media
guidelines and training for health workers. Resources
should be allocated for achieving both short-to-medium
and long-term objectives; there should be eﬀective plan-
ning, and the strategy should be regularly evaluated,
with evaluation ﬁndings feeding into future planning.
It is essential that governments assume their role of
leadership, as they can bring together a multitude of
stakeholders who may not otherwise collaborate.","Luxton DD, June JD, Comtois KA (2013). Can postdischarge

It has been argued that search engines like Google can be seen
as meta-sources for information on various topics and that search
results on a certain topic may be representative of Internet
content at large: “Google search volumes reflect a large
proportion of all available Internet search data on the chosen
term, thereby capturing a vast amount of information” [27].
The aim of this quantitative study is to examine how the subject
of suicide is represented to users on the Internet by proxy of
hits for the word suicide generated by the search engine Google.
The specific research questions that the study is designed to
answer are:
•
Who are the senders of the information about suicide on
the Internet?
•
How is the subject of suicide communicated? Is it primarily
through a monological or a dialogical communication?
•
What categories of content on the suicide subject appear
on the Internet?
•
Which discourse about suicide predominates on the
Internet?
Methods","communication event, which is a ‘ . . . set of circumstances in
which a person expresses suicidal feelings, thoughts, intentions

suicide communication events are the most important and
observable features in the suicide process.
Although not that common, there have been a number of cases
in recent years where people have displayed their suicidal act online.

Google.
Methods: In an exploratory design, Google search results on the target word “suicide”, for the years 2005, 2009, and 2012
respectively, were systematically analyzed and compared.

as being relatively stable [12,13], it appears that the impact of being sufﬁciently trained to
work with suicidal individuals is a more important predictor than age, gender, and work
experience on attitudes concerning work with these individuals [14]. However, despite the
attitudes toward suicide and its prevention being frequently used as outcomes, there is a
lack of agreement on how to measure these attitudes. There are a variety of questionnaires
available, but few have been investigated appropriately with regard to their psychometric
properties.
Three often-used instruments that aim to investigate a broad aspect of attitudes in
the general population or in subpopulations include the Suicide Opinion Scale (SOQ) by
Domino et al. [15], the suicide attitude questionnaire (SUIATT) by Diekstra and Kerhof [16],
and Attitudes towards suicide (ATTS) by Renberg and Jakobsson [17]. Although these","Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2011, 8

comprising suicidal content. Among those web pages, 11% were considered to be contain obvious  
pro-suicide material; 30% was deemed to be suicide-neutral, and 29% was anti-suicide [48,53]. 
It is important to note that pro-suicide communication on the Internet seems to have become more 
common over time. A study using the Google search engine to investigate the prevalence of suicide-
related material on the Internet showed that there was a proportional increase in pro-suicide messages 
and discussions between 2005 and 2009 [54]. 
In the 2009 study Internet monitoring of suicide risk in the population, McCarthy [55] utilized a 
service provided by Google, entitled Google Trends. This service provides search volumes, i.e., data 
about what information users have searched for over time. McCarthy compared the search volumes using"

Responsible media reporting
Inappropriate media reporting practices can sensatio-
nalize and glamourize suicide and increase the risk
of ‘copycat’ suicides (imitation of suicides) among vul-
nerable people. Responsible reporting of suicide in the
media has been shown to decrease suicide rates.
Important aspects of responsible reporting include:
avoiding detailed descriptions of suicidal acts, avoid-
ing sensationalism and glamorization, using respon-
sible
language,
minimizing
the
prominence
and
duration of suicide reports, avoiding oversimpliﬁca-
tions, educating the public about suicide and available
treatments, and providing information on where to
seek help. Media collaboration and participation in
the development, dissemination and training of re-
sponsible reporting practices are also essential for suc-
cessfully improving the reporting of suicide and
reducing
suicide
imitation
(Pirkis,
2009).
These
improvements were demonstrated in Australia and","i.e., that media coverage of suicide can trigger actual suicidal behavior in vulnerable individuals in
the audiences. Some studies have also investigated whether media recommendations on responsible
reporting suicide cases have a protective inﬂuence, known as the “papageno effect”, on consumers.
Niederkrotenthaler, Voracek [3] conducted studies that indicate this type of preventive effect. Not
so surprisingly, these types of studies on media-effects in suicide focus mainly on media reporting a
suicide-speciﬁc theme. However, the suicide-related effects of more general media consumption, such
as reading books or watching ﬁlms with non-speciﬁc themes, are largely unknown.
Protective factors are less often the focus of research on youth suicides compared to risk factors.
Adolescents’ perceptions of belonging have been shown to be related to depression, social rejection,
and school problems, as well as to suicidality [4], probably due to a lack of social support. In this","Original Paper

Background: Suicide is one of the major causes of death in the world, leading to approximately 1 million deaths per year. While","opportunity to discuss with each other, comment on/change the
contents, or only to receive the contents without interaction.
Content: this refers to the type of information provided on the
website, for example: scientific findings versus specific
suicide-related events such as the death of a celebrity, or
personal “confessions” and discussions about suicide.
Discourse: this variable aimed to capture how the topic of
suicide was approached. The current medical-psychiatric view,
where suicide is seen as harmful behavior, both for the
individual and society, and something that is preventable and
treatable was contrasted to views promoting/enticing the act of
suicide as valid solution to problems in life, and/or suggesting
methods and means to commit suicide.

Research and suicide-prevention is the most common content
in the search hits on suicide in all of the studied years. In the
2005 material, 61 (73%) of the search hits fell into this category;
in 2009, it was 23 (48%); and in the 2012 material, 61 (74%)
of the search hits were categorized as research and
suicide-prevention (Table 4).
The relatively small share of personal and intimate statements
and conversations about suicide, found in the category
confessions, has been fairly the same for all the three years
(Table 4).

Three good-ﬁtting measurement models, which were valid and reliable over time,
were found when they were analyzed with CFA on a heterogenous sample of individuals,
whose unifying characteristic was their exposure to suicidal individuals during the past
six months. These models measure attitudes toward prevention, attitudes toward suicidal
persons, and organizational-facilitated self-efﬁcacy. The ﬁnal questionnaire and its included
items are presented below (Table 7).

1. Introduction
Measuring attitudes toward suicide and suicide prevention has been an endeavor
of many researchers in the ﬁeld of suicidology since the 1980s. Interventions aiming to
improve attitudes toward suicide prevention are common elements of multi-component
suicide preventive strategies [1,2] as the stigma surrounding suicide in the population could
be a perceived hindrance for preventing suicidal acts. Attitudes toward suicide also play an
important role in the willingness to implement suicide preventive interventions [3], as well
as in facilitating the acceptance and effect of these interventions. Furthermore, the stigma
surrounding suicide might inﬂuence the quality and effectiveness of care and, consequently,","of suicide-preventive training. Due to various problems related to the validity and reliability of
commonly used scales, there is a lack of overall agreement on how to measure these attitudes.
Conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to cross-validate previously used models and to
investigate new models to measure professionals’ attitudes toward work with suicidal individuals
and to test the longitudinal stability of the models by analyzing new sets of data. The population
in the ﬁrst study consisted of a heterogenous group of 1350 professionals who managed suicidal
individuals relatively frequently. The second study included 640 professionals. The results of the
cross-validation of previous models were described and a new questionnaire measuring attitudes
toward suicide prevention, suicidal individuals, and organizational-facilitated self-efﬁcacy (OSAQ-
12) was presented. The three presented models retained a good ﬁt and were stable over time. Valid","Suicide Prevention. A Global Perspective, 2nd ed.; Wasserman, D., Wasserman, C., Eds.; Oxford University Press: Oxford, UK, 2013;

vention. The cross-validations were performed on the total sample of 1350 respondents
that had reported working with suicidal individuals during the past six months.
3.1.2. Tests of the Hypothesized Measurement Models
To test the hypothesized measurement models of Job support and Attitudes toward
suicidal persons, the N = 1350 respondents that had reported working with suicidal
individuals during the past six months were randomly allocated into two test groups

Reaching the global target reduction of the suicide
rate in countries
For national responses to be eﬀective, a comprehensive
multisectoral suicide prevention strategy, including
good-quality data, is essential (Vijayakumar et al.
2005). A national strategy indicates a government’s
clear commitment to dealing with the issue of suicide.
Typically, national strategies comprise a range of pre-
vention strategies, such as means restriction, media
guidelines and training for health workers. Resources
should be allocated for achieving both short-to-medium
and long-term objectives; there should be eﬀective plan-
ning, and the strategy should be regularly evaluated,
with evaluation ﬁndings feeding into future planning.
It is essential that governments assume their role of
leadership, as they can bring together a multitude of
stakeholders who may not otherwise collaborate.","stakeholders who may not otherwise collaborate.
Governments are also in a unique position to develop
and strengthen surveillance, resulting in better quality
and availability of both suicide and suicide attempt
data, and to provide and disseminate data that are
necessary to inform action (WHO, 2014a).
In countries where a fully developed, comprehen-
sive national strategy is not yet in place, this should
not delay implementing targeted suicide prevention
programmes since these can contribute to a national re-
sponse. Regardless of the current level of implemen-
tation, all LMICs can commence on strategic actions
for suicide prevention. Steps to engage stakeholders,
reduce access to means, build surveillance, raise aware-
ness, engage media, train health workers and change
attitudes can be started according to each context
(WHO, 2014a). Even if it is considered that a country
is not yet ready to have a national prevention strategy,","and reliable measurement models that measure aspects of attitudes toward suicide are a prerequisite

Positive outcomes for prevention most likely derive
from strategies involving comprehensive, multisectoral
participation, involving health care, education, em-
ployment, social welfare, justice, agriculture, nongo-
vernmental organizations, community organizations
and others working together in a coordinated manner.
One of the most challenging ﬁndings of the WHO re-
port was the large variation in the rates and demo-
graphic characteristics of suicide across regions and
between countries. Therefore, it is likely that a range
of diﬀerent types of interventions will be needed to tai-
lor strategies to each country’s cultural and social
context.

the national response, stakeholders become commit-

able groups are identiﬁed, research priorities are
ﬁxed, and public and media awareness are increased
to ultimately reach the goal of reducing the suicide
rate in countries. Particularly in countries with limited
resources, the importance of communities and their
support of suicide prevention programmes cannot be
overstated (WHO, 2014a).

1. Introduction
Measuring attitudes toward suicide and suicide prevention has been an endeavor
of many researchers in the ﬁeld of suicidology since the 1980s. Interventions aiming to
improve attitudes toward suicide prevention are common elements of multi-component
suicide preventive strategies [1,2] as the stigma surrounding suicide in the population could
be a perceived hindrance for preventing suicidal acts. Attitudes toward suicide also play an
important role in the willingness to implement suicide preventive interventions [3], as well
as in facilitating the acceptance and effect of these interventions. Furthermore, the stigma
surrounding suicide might inﬂuence the quality and effectiveness of care and, consequently,","Public Attitudes about Suicide (SPAS) by Li XY et al. [22].
Seven of the 19 intervention studies found by Boukouvalas et al. [18] were performed
with ad hoc questionnaires constructed by the authors for the purpose of the study. Five of
the studies used the Suicide Behavior Attitude Questionnaire (SBAQ), which was devel-
oped by Botega et al. [23], two used the USP-scale, and one used the SOQ. Examples of
less frequently used scales are the Attitudes to Suicide Prevention Scale [ASPS] by Herron
et al. [24] and the Depression Stigma Scale (DSS) by Grifﬁths et al. [25].
Some of the measurement properties of the scales used in these cross-sectional and
intervention studies were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) or reliability
tests such as Cronbach’s alpha. Cronbach’s alpha is widely used to scrutinize the internal
consistency and homogeneity of scales. However, not without criticism, for instance, Cho","Ajdacic-Gross V, Weiss MG, Ring M, Hepp U, Bopp M,

at high risk of suicidal behavior (based on the Paykel Suicide Scale; [46,47]). Participants’
identities were encrypted in the questionnaire using unique participation codes, which
enabled questionnaire data to be connected longitudinally, and making contact information
available to emergency intervention staff. The participants provided personal information
on a separate sheet of paper, which, in turn, provided them with instructions about the data
collection, as well as their pseudonymized questionnaire log-in details. Written consent was
obtained from all participants, and from their legal guardians in cases where the participant
was under 15 years of age. Participants were free to ask questions about the survey and
questionnaire items to a supervising data collector. The study was approved by the regional
ethics committee in Stockholm (ref.no/ 2016/2175-31/5).","Year

Research and suicide-prevention is the most common content
in the search hits on suicide in all of the studied years. In the
2005 material, 61 (73%) of the search hits fell into this category;
in 2009, it was 23 (48%); and in the 2012 material, 61 (74%)
of the search hits were categorized as research and
suicide-prevention (Table 4).
The relatively small share of personal and intimate statements
and conversations about suicide, found in the category
confessions, has been fairly the same for all the three years
(Table 4).

with family, healthcare professionals and help sites is less satisfying.
Even though suicide and suicide attempts may be seen as a
consequence of internal psychic conflicts, it is also clear that
external factors play a significant role in the complex suicidal
process.19 Many studies have shown that a large proportion of
those who attempt suicide have communicated their suicidal
intent and plans, directly or indirectly, to other people before
the act.20 A review of studies on suicide communication showed
that between a third and a half of individuals who die by
suicide had directly communicated their suicidal intentions to
people around them.21 If indirect communication is included,
the proportion rises to 60–80%.20 Owen et al take the concept
of suicide communication further and define it as a suicide

at high risk of suicidal behavior (based on the Paykel Suicide Scale; [46,47]). Participants’
identities were encrypted in the questionnaire using unique participation codes, which
enabled questionnaire data to be connected longitudinally, and making contact information
available to emergency intervention staff. The participants provided personal information
on a separate sheet of paper, which, in turn, provided them with instructions about the data
collection, as well as their pseudonymized questionnaire log-in details. Written consent was
obtained from all participants, and from their legal guardians in cases where the participant
was under 15 years of age. Participants were free to ask questions about the survey and
questionnaire items to a supervising data collector. The study was approved by the regional
ethics committee in Stockholm (ref.no/ 2016/2175-31/5).","J Prev Med Public Health 2009; 42: 183–9.

suicide-related material [33,34]. These findings are congruent

not as clear in the 2012 material. Another recent study also
points out that the preventive websites are more visible and
accessible on the Internet today compared to those that are
pro-suicide [35]. This does not necessarily mean that pro-suicide
websites have declined in numbers; they’re just not as prevalent
among the first 100 search results, when using the more general
search term suicide. This could be due to a recent and deliberate
strategy (eg, search engine optimization) from suicide-preventive
actors to make their websites more reachable and popular, and
thereby get a better ranking in the search results lists. Hopefully
it is an increased awareness about the risks that pro-suicide
websites may have on vulnerable Internet users that lies behind","the first ten hits on the results page, the study outcomes were thus confined to this criterion. This

Senders
The 2005 material shows that 65 (77%) of the 84 Google hits
on the search term suicide come from institutional senders and
19 (23%) from private senders (Table 2). The frequencies for
2009 and 2012 confirm that institutional senders are the largest
category. Yet, the 2005, 2009 and 2012 material has a large
proportion of private senders in the more relevant search
positions (the first ten search hits), which indicates that these
senders’ websites are relatively visible and highly attended.

nerable people. Responsible reporting of suicide in the
media has been shown to decrease suicide rates.
Important aspects of responsible reporting include:
avoiding detailed descriptions of suicidal acts, avoid-
ing sensationalism and glamorization, using respon-
sible
language,
minimizing
the
prominence
and
duration of suicide reports, avoiding oversimpliﬁca-
tions, educating the public about suicide and available
treatments, and providing information on where to
seek help. Media collaboration and participation in
the development, dissemination and training of re-
sponsible reporting practices are also essential for suc-
cessfully improving the reporting of suicide and
reducing

These
improvements were demonstrated in Australia and","i.e., that media coverage of suicide can trigger actual suicidal behavior in vulnerable individuals in
the audiences. Some studies have also investigated whether media recommendations on responsible
reporting suicide cases have a protective inﬂuence, known as the “papageno effect”, on consumers.
Niederkrotenthaler, Voracek [3] conducted studies that indicate this type of preventive effect. Not
so surprisingly, these types of studies on media-effects in suicide focus mainly on media reporting a
suicide-speciﬁc theme. However, the suicide-related effects of more general media consumption, such
as reading books or watching ﬁlms with non-speciﬁc themes, are largely unknown.
Protective factors are less often the focus of research on youth suicides compared to risk factors.
Adolescents’ perceptions of belonging have been shown to be related to depression, social rejection,
and school problems, as well as to suicidality [4], probably due to a lack of social support. In this","imitation

2009).
These
improvements were demonstrated in Australia and
Austria following active media involvement in the dis-
semination of media guidelines (Bohanna & Wang,
2012).
Common
sense
suggests
that
responsible
media reporting about suicide would be eﬀective in
all jurisdictions, but further evidence is needed inter-
nationally to conﬁrm the value of this type of inter-
vention for reducing suicides in LMICs.
Introducing mental health and alcohol policies
Whilst mental health should constitute a priority for all
governments, suicide prevention eﬀorts should be
broadened beyond improving the recognition and
treatment of mental disorders. For example, the role
of alcohol and substance use disorders in the etiology
of suicidal behaviour has traditionally received much
less attention than that of other types of mental disor-
ders such as depression, but it has become increasingly
evident that alcohol and drugs are important prevent-","responsible reporting of suicide. A review of eﬀectiveness.

1. Introduction
Measuring attitudes toward suicide and suicide prevention has been an endeavor
of many researchers in the ﬁeld of suicidology since the 1980s. Interventions aiming to
improve attitudes toward suicide prevention are common elements of multi-component
suicide preventive strategies [1,2] as the stigma surrounding suicide in the population could
be a perceived hindrance for preventing suicidal acts. Attitudes toward suicide also play an
important role in the willingness to implement suicide preventive interventions [3], as well
as in facilitating the acceptance and effect of these interventions. Furthermore, the stigma
surrounding suicide might inﬂuence the quality and effectiveness of care and, consequently,","Table 1. Constructs and items (cross-validation study).

TARGETED SUICIDE PREVENTION–TIME FOR CHANGE?
Suicide is a global public health concern, with more than 800,000 worldwide deaths, annually. The
World Health Organization has set a global target to reduce the rates of suicides by 10% by 2020
(1, 2) The concept of suicidal behavior encapsulates thoughts, plans and acts an individual makes
toward intentionally ending their own life (3).
For targeted suicide prevention strategies to be eﬀective for those with mental health problems,
high-quality and accessible data from health services is essential (1). With the increased availability
of electronic data from public health services and patient-generated data online, advances in data-
driven methods could transform the ways in which psychiatric health services are provided (4–6)."

Background
Depressive disorders are one of the leading causes of the
burden of disease globally. It is the third leading cause of
disability worldwide [1] with an estimated one-year
prevalence of depression of approximately 3% in the
general population [2]. This increases significantly in in-
dividuals with severe somatic conditions as there is a
high likelihood of developing a comorbid mental illness.
The prevalence of depressive symptoms in patients who
have suffered acute myocardial infarction (MI) is esti-
mated at 14% [3] while the prevalence in individuals
with chronic kidney disease can range between 26 and
39% [4]. Depressive symptoms are defined as symptoms
experienced by patients as identified with self-reported"

This group of non-respondents may in some way have deferred from the
studied population. However, in comparison to other similar studies an attrition rate of 30% is very
low [74].In future studies we will test whether the training in suicide prevention that was given to
those who participated in the study presented in this paper had a positive effect on their attitudes
towards work and the possibility to prevent suicidal behavior.
4. Conclusions
Providing suicide preventive education to health-care staff is likely to improving their attitudes
towards the preventability of suicide, improving clarity regarding their role in the care for suicidal
patients, and their general conﬁdence in their suicide preventive activities. These improvements are
likely to contribute to the prevention of suicide in the health care setting.

utilized in suicide preventive interventions, among which, includes the Universal/Selective/Indicated 
(USI) model. In the USI model, the universal intervention targets the general population, the selective 
intervention targets subgroups at-risk for suicide, and the indicated intervention is aimed at high-risk 
suicidal individuals who already begun self-destructive behaviours [89]. The USI model that adopts

INTRODUCTION
In Sweden, suicide is one of the most common single causes of death. With a population of 10
million people, approximately 1,500 individuals die by suicide every year (National centre for
suicide research and prevention, 2019). Every death to suicide has a ripple eﬀect and is estimated
to deeply aﬀect at least 6 to 14 relatives and close friends (Clark and Goldney, 2000; Jones and
Meier, 2011; Jordan and McIntosh, 2011). Looking beyond the immediate group of bereaved family

viewed the helpline as a safe space, a partner, or an alternative to bad professional services. Users oriented to ongoing helpline usage as crucial
for their well-being while they described using professional mental health services to be able to stay alive. Limitations: The findings are limited to
the nature of the different themes. Conclusion: The view on crisis helplines as a short-term intervention relies on an idealized view on crisis
intervention that does not represent users’ views. User control is at the core of the appeal of helplines, but it is also a key challenge for

The 2005 material shows that 65 (77%) of the 84 Google hits
on the search term suicide come from institutional senders and
19 (23%) from private senders (Table 2). The frequencies for
2009 and 2012 confirm that institutional senders are the largest
category. Yet, the 2005, 2009 and 2012 material has a large
proportion of private senders in the more relevant search
positions (the first ten search hits), which indicates that these
senders’ websites are relatively visible and highly attended.

TARGETED SUICIDE PREVENTION–TIME FOR CHANGE?
Suicide is a global public health concern, with more than 800,000 worldwide deaths, annually. The
World Health Organization has set a global target to reduce the rates of suicides by 10% by 2020
(1, 2) The concept of suicidal behavior encapsulates thoughts, plans and acts an individual makes
toward intentionally ending their own life (3).
For targeted suicide prevention strategies to be eﬀective for those with mental health problems,
high-quality and accessible data from health services is essential (1). With the increased availability
of electronic data from public health services and patient-generated data online, advances in data-
driven methods could transform the ways in which psychiatric health services are provided (4–6)."

Methods: We used thematic analysis of 100 naturally occurring interactions from a Swedish online crisis helpline. Results: The users

for their well-being while they described using professional mental health services to be able to stay alive. Limitations: The findings are limited to
the nature of the different themes. Conclusion: The view on crisis helplines as a short-term intervention relies on an idealized view on crisis
intervention that does not represent users’ views. User control is at the core of the appeal of helplines, but it is also a key challenge for

been found to be discriminative for patients who died from
suicide, with an increased relative frequency closer to the event
(46). Positive valence in discharge summaries (e.g., terms like
glad, pleasant) has also been associated with diminished risk of
death by suicide (25).

This group of non-respondents may in some way have deferred from the
studied population. However, in comparison to other similar studies an attrition rate of 30% is very
low [74].In future studies we will test whether the training in suicide prevention that was given to
those who participated in the study presented in this paper had a positive effect on their attitudes
towards work and the possibility to prevent suicidal behavior.
4. Conclusions
Providing suicide preventive education to health-care staff is likely to improving their attitudes
towards the preventability of suicide, improving clarity regarding their role in the care for suicidal
patients, and their general conﬁdence in their suicide preventive activities. These improvements are
likely to contribute to the prevention of suicide in the health care setting.

Follow-up care and community support following
a suicide attempt
Recently discharged patients often lack social support
and can feel isolated once they leave care. Follow-up
and community support have been eﬀective in reduc-
ing suicide deaths and attempts among patients who
have been recently discharged from the health care sys-
tem (Luxton et al. 2013). Repeated follow-ups are a
recommended low-cost intervention that is easy to im-
plement; existing treatment staﬀ, including trained
non-specialized health workers, can implement the in-
tervention and require few resources (WHO, 2010b).

nized in high-income countries. The intervention can
involve the use of postcards, telephone calls or brief

Reaching the global target reduction of the suicide
rate in countries
For national responses to be eﬀective, a comprehensive
multisectoral suicide prevention strategy, including
good-quality data, is essential (Vijayakumar et al.
2005). A national strategy indicates a government’s
clear commitment to dealing with the issue of suicide.
Typically, national strategies comprise a range of pre-
vention strategies, such as means restriction, media
guidelines and training for health workers. Resources
should be allocated for achieving both short-to-medium
and long-term objectives; there should be eﬀective plan-
ning, and the strategy should be regularly evaluated,
with evaluation ﬁndings feeding into future planning.
It is essential that governments assume their role of
leadership, as they can bring together a multitude of
stakeholders who may not otherwise collaborate.","can play a critical role by restricting the amount of
medication dispensed, informing patients and their

One central problem in implementing means restric-
tion strategies is that very few LMICs have accurate in-
formation on the methods used in suicides and suicide
attempts. These methods often vary by geographic re-
gion (urban v. rural), gender, and age group, and, as
the example of charcoal burning in China, Hong
Kong SAR indicates, preferred methods can change
rapidly over time. Targeted means restriction interven-
tions require simultaneous monitoring of the methods
employed in suicidal behaviour to ensure that the most
common methods are being addressed, to monitor
possible substitution when access to one method is re-
stricted, and to adapt strategies as preferred methods

Responsible media reporting
Inappropriate media reporting practices can sensatio-
nalize and glamourize suicide and increase the risk
of ‘copycat’ suicides (imitation of suicides) among vul-
nerable people. Responsible reporting of suicide in the
media has been shown to decrease suicide rates.
Important aspects of responsible reporting include:
avoiding detailed descriptions of suicidal acts, avoid-
ing sensationalism and glamorization, using respon-
sible
language,
minimizing
the
prominence
and
duration of suicide reports, avoiding oversimpliﬁca-
tions, educating the public about suicide and available
treatments, and providing information on where to
seek help. Media collaboration and participation in
the development, dissemination and training of re-
sponsible reporting practices are also essential for suc-
cessfully improving the reporting of suicide and
reducing

(Pirkis,
2009).
These
improvements were demonstrated in Australia and","i.e., that media coverage of suicide can trigger actual suicidal behavior in vulnerable individuals in
the audiences. Some studies have also investigated whether media recommendations on responsible
reporting suicide cases have a protective inﬂuence, known as the “papageno effect”, on consumers.
Niederkrotenthaler, Voracek [3] conducted studies that indicate this type of preventive effect. Not
so surprisingly, these types of studies on media-effects in suicide focus mainly on media reporting a
suicide-speciﬁc theme. However, the suicide-related effects of more general media consumption, such
as reading books or watching ﬁlms with non-speciﬁc themes, are largely unknown.
Protective factors are less often the focus of research on youth suicides compared to risk factors.

1. Introduction
Measuring attitudes toward suicide and suicide prevention has been an endeavor
of many researchers in the ﬁeld of suicidology since the 1980s. Interventions aiming to
improve attitudes toward suicide prevention are common elements of multi-component
suicide preventive strategies [1,2] as the stigma surrounding suicide in the population could
be a perceived hindrance for preventing suicidal acts. Attitudes toward suicide also play an
important role in the willingness to implement suicide preventive interventions [3], as well
as in facilitating the acceptance and effect of these interventions. Furthermore, the stigma
surrounding suicide might inﬂuence the quality and effectiveness of care and, consequently,","analytic procedure that enables tests of the constructs of the models, as well as their validity
and reliability. The resulting questionnaire was stable over time and may be used to
measure attitudes toward suicide prevention, for instance, in studies evaluating suicide-
preventive training programs, or to identify the impact of healthcare workers’ attitudes on
the prevention of suicide.

INTRODUCTION
In Sweden, suicide is one of the most common single causes of death. With a population of 10
million people, approximately 1,500 individuals die by suicide every year (National centre for
suicide research and prevention, 2019). Every death to suicide has a ripple eﬀect and is estimated
to deeply aﬀect at least 6 to 14 relatives and close friends (Clark and Goldney, 2000; Jones and

Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study evaluating a

adds to the existing research by presenting an e-health
system that successfully reduces depressive symptoms

care. It is possible to adjust the NEVERMIND system to
include participants with other somatic conditions, as
well as primary psychiatric conditions, by including con-

Background
Depressive disorders are one of the leading causes of the
burden of disease globally. It is the third leading cause of
disability worldwide [1] with an estimated one-year
prevalence of depression of approximately 3% in the
general population [2]. This increases significantly in in-
dividuals with severe somatic conditions as there is a
high likelihood of developing a comorbid mental illness.
The prevalence of depressive symptoms in patients who
have suffered acute myocardial infarction (MI) is esti-
mated at 14% [3] while the prevalence in individuals
with chronic kidney disease can range between 26 and
39% [4]. Depressive symptoms are defined as symptoms
experienced by patients as identified with self-reported","(F31.3–F31.9),

Abstract
Background: Depressive symptoms are common in individuals suffering from severe somatic conditions. There is a
lack of interventions and evidence-based interventions aiming to reduce depressive symptoms in patients with
severe somatic conditions. The aim of the NEVERMIND project is to address these issues and provide evidence by"

3.2. Discussion
The focus of this study was on attitudes surrounding working with suicidal patients and the
preventability of suicidal acts, as these are considered important aspects regarding quality of care and
the psychiatric staffs’ perceived ability of preventing suicidal acts among patients [15–19]. A number
of attitude items have been tested using conﬁrmative factor analyses to establish the dimensionality of
the items. These tests resulted in three models measuring the concepts of clarity in work with suicidal
patients (Job clarity), conﬁdence in work with suicidal patients (Job conﬁdence) and attitudes regarding
the prevention of suicidal acts (Attitudes towards prevention) and the models have been found to be
satisfactorily valid according to recommendations by Jöreskogs & Sörboms [61,62]. However, the cutoff
values for various goodness of ﬁt indexes are discussed and stricter rules might be recommended.","Stats, 2010 [27]. 
 
The increase in Internet usage is also illustrated predominantly among the adolescent age-groups. In 
EU-27, statistics demonstrate that 90% of young people aged 16–24 years used the Internet regularly 
during 2010 [28]. Due to the widespread use of the Internet on most continents, research concerning its 
implications on mental health and suicidal behaviours necessitate scientific review. 
The general aim of this study was to review the scientific literature concerning the Internet and 
suicidality; and examine the different pathways by which suicidal risks and prevention efforts  
are facilitated through the Internet. The main themes that were investigated included: pathological 
Internet use and suicidality, pro-suicide websites, suicide pacts on the Internet, and suicide prevention 
via the Internet.

mention any adjustment for potential confounders and in the others there was a large variability in the factors considered for adjustment.

Conclusions: We cannot draw conclusions about the efectiveness of STP from currently available data. Large, possibly multi-centric
studies, employing experimental or a quasi-experimental design to assess the efectiveness of STPs are needed. Characteristics that could
be studied are: degree of formality, participants to which the policy applies, extension of the ban (indoor areas or external school premises),

In conclusion
Risky practices and exposure to harm begin early in 
a young person’s life today, requiring new approaches 
and strategies across sectors. Today’s children and 
adolescents face growing challenges and threats: inju­
ries, violence, substance abuse, unsafe sex, mental 
ill-health, and obesity. While these are mostly preven­
table, the rapidly changing socio-economic, political, 
demographic, and technological realities are likely to 
further increase vulnerabilities.
Reducing the burden of major diseases such as 
mental ill-health and obesity in middle childhood 
requires data, policies and earlier interventions that 
recognise the particular needs of this population."

Information relating to context (e.g. social, political and cultural

Several STP components can play an essential role in contributing
to policy efectiveness; the most important ones suggested by this
review are:
•
degree of formality: form of statements of the policy (whether
written or other);
•
participants to which the policy applies (students, staf, visitors/
guests);
•
extent of the ban (in all indoor areas or on external school
premises);
•
level of enforcement including: rules for surveillance and
for referral of smoking ban infringements; definition of the
person responsible for policy evaluation and review; agenda for
periodic evaluation and policy review;
•
sanctions for transgression;
•
assistance with smoking cessation;
•
combination with prevention and education activities.","If so, why and how?

The increase in Internet usage is also illustrated predominantly among the adolescent age-groups. In 
EU-27, statistics demonstrate that 90% of young people aged 16–24 years used the Internet regularly 
during 2010 [28]. Due to the widespread use of the Internet on most continents, research concerning its 
implications on mental health and suicidal behaviours necessitate scientific review. 
The general aim of this study was to review the scientific literature concerning the Internet and 
suicidality; and examine the different pathways by which suicidal risks and prevention efforts  
are facilitated through the Internet. The main themes that were investigated included: pathological 
Internet use and suicidality, pro-suicide websites, suicide pacts on the Internet, and suicide prevention 
via the Internet.

3.2. Discussion
The focus of this study was on attitudes surrounding working with suicidal patients and the
preventability of suicidal acts, as these are considered important aspects regarding quality of care and
the psychiatric staffs’ perceived ability of preventing suicidal acts among patients [15–19]. A number
of attitude items have been tested using conﬁrmative factor analyses to establish the dimensionality of
the items. These tests resulted in three models measuring the concepts of clarity in work with suicidal
patients (Job clarity), conﬁdence in work with suicidal patients (Job conﬁdence) and attitudes regarding
the prevention of suicidal acts (Attitudes towards prevention) and the models have been found to be
satisfactorily valid according to recommendations by Jöreskogs & Sörboms [61,62]. However, the cutoff
values for various goodness of ﬁt indexes are discussed and stricter rules might be recommended."

participants that posted on the issue (n = 470) during and after
the suicide still believed that the suicide act was a fake.
Attitudes to the TS’s suicide
Of the 344 posted messages that express an opinion about the TS’s
suicide, nearly half (49%) state that his suicide is tragic, terrible or
shocking (Fig. 2), for example:
‘Horrible. Moreover, this kind tends to rub off and inspire others. Hope that the TS is in
a better place now.’
‘rest in peace TS. I was too late to write something that would make you change your
mind. Very sad way to end one’s life.’
‘Goddamn shit, so fucking tragic.’
However, 24% of the posts say that the suicide is exciting, interesting
or funny (Fig. 2):
‘Call me sick, but have never laughed so much in my life lol [a common acronym used
in internet slang that means ‘‘laughing out loud’’].’
‘Well who cares . . . one tramp less, moreover, it is probably a fake.’

Additionally, we found that there were signiﬁcant differences already in the level of subthreshold
anxiety with small effect size between those who: (a) suffered or didn’t suffer from chronic illness,
(b) described their state of health poor/very poor and good/very good, and (c) reported that the
discomforts due to their chronic illnesses lower or do not lower their daily abilities somewhat/certainly.
All these data show that in the case of physical illnesses and poor self-rated health physicians have to
screen the symptoms of anxiety already in a subthreshold level. The data in this paper supports
previous studies, which underline the role of comorbidity of anxiety with psychical symptoms
in adolescents [1–7]. Moreover, the current study highlights the importance of recognition and
appropriate intervention already for subthreshold anxiety in adolescents with physical disorders","in suicide attempts. In our study, we show the involvement of loss aversion in particular,

suicide attempt because of a greater focus on the negative consequences of the decision.

The increase in Internet usage is also illustrated predominantly among the adolescent age-groups. In 
EU-27, statistics demonstrate that 90% of young people aged 16–24 years used the Internet regularly 
during 2010 [28]. Due to the widespread use of the Internet on most continents, research concerning its 
implications on mental health and suicidal behaviours necessitate scientific review. 
The general aim of this study was to review the scientific literature concerning the Internet and 
suicidality; and examine the different pathways by which suicidal risks and prevention efforts  
are facilitated through the Internet. The main themes that were investigated included: pathological 
Internet use and suicidality, pro-suicide websites, suicide pacts on the Internet, and suicide prevention 
via the Internet.

Additionally, we found that there were signiﬁcant differences already in the level of subthreshold
anxiety with small effect size between those who: (a) suffered or didn’t suffer from chronic illness,
(b) described their state of health poor/very poor and good/very good, and (c) reported that the
discomforts due to their chronic illnesses lower or do not lower their daily abilities somewhat/certainly.
All these data show that in the case of physical illnesses and poor self-rated health physicians have to
screen the symptoms of anxiety already in a subthreshold level. The data in this paper supports
previous studies, which underline the role of comorbidity of anxiety with psychical symptoms
in adolescents [1–7]. Moreover, the current study highlights the importance of recognition and

Measuring attitudes toward suicide and suicide prevention has been an endeavor
of many researchers in the ﬁeld of suicidology since the 1980s. Interventions aiming to
improve attitudes toward suicide prevention are common elements of multi-component
suicide preventive strategies [1,2] as the stigma surrounding suicide in the population could
be a perceived hindrance for preventing suicidal acts. Attitudes toward suicide also play an
important role in the willingness to implement suicide preventive interventions [3], as well
as in facilitating the acceptance and effect of these interventions. Furthermore, the stigma
surrounding suicide might inﬂuence the quality and effectiveness of care and, consequently,","In one study, performed over a 11-month period, the results illustrated that the discussion members

behavior, that can be analyzed with data-driven methods (66–68).
The growth of online support networks is an issue that could
be integrated in research and health and social care processes
(69). Deploying prevention systems that can also operate to
improve public health and wellbeing is a another area of growing
interest to researchers and policy makers (70, 71). A considerable
number of suicides occur in people who have not received any
prior mental health assessment or treatment (72). Reliable suicide
detection from data generated outside of the healthcare setting is
one way of addressing this issue. For instance, moderated online
social media-based therapy has been successfully developed for
ﬁrst episode psychosis patients (73). With appropriate ethical
research protocols in place (74), this approach could serve as
inspiration for developing moderated intervention programmes","of suicide-preventive training. Due to various problems related to the validity and reliability of

Methods: We used thematic analysis of 100 naturally occurring interactions from a Swedish online crisis helpline. Results: The users
viewed the helpline as a safe space, a partner, or an alternative to bad professional services. Users oriented to ongoing helpline usage as crucial
for their well-being while they described using professional mental health services to be able to stay alive. Limitations: The findings are limited to
the nature of the different themes. Conclusion: The view on crisis helplines as a short-term intervention relies on an idealized view on crisis
intervention that does not represent users’ views. User control is at the core of the appeal of helplines, but it is also a key challenge for

Westerlund and Krysinska (2021) noted that brief online
sessions, even by a highly skilled and experienced vol-
unteer, are not likely to stop or reverse the suicidal
trajectory. The suicidal process is complex and develops
over time (Wasserman, 2016), involving factors such as
social conditions, mental health issues, and interper-
sonal dynamics (Sveticic & De Leo, 2012). Even after
care, suicidal thoughts and behavior often persist (Kemp
et al., 2021). In line with this, Sindahl et al. (2019) argue
that crisis helplines should aim to reduce imminent risk
of suicide and encourage the use of long-term coun-
seling, which can address issues contributing to the onset
and maintenance of suicidality.
The view of helplines – online and offline – as a short-
term intervention that should provide a way into profes-
sional mental health services is present in many agenda

Limitations
A limitation of the present study is that it only examines suicide
communication at a single time on one forum on the internet.
However, on interactive internet forums where communication
about suicide takes place, different voices and different views
may be heard on this problematic, taboo subject. Further studies
with this focus can expand our understanding and knowledge of

Participants that did not report working with
suicidal individuals at least once a month during the past six months were excluded from
the analyses. Of the 1350 included respondents in the ﬁrst study, 84% were females, 15.5%
were males, and 0.5% reported “other”. The mean age was 43.95 (SD 11.555). In the second
study, 648 (83.5% females, 16.4% males, 0.2% “others”) respondents were included. The

2.2. Items
This study analyzed 22 items that aimed to examine various aspects of attitudes
toward work with suicidal individuals (see Tables 1 and 2). The responses to all items
were scored using a Likert scale with numbers of 1 (do not agree at all), 2 (hardly agree), 3
(almost agree), and 4 (agree completely). The values for the negative items were reversed,
i.e., the higher value, the more positive the attitudes.

Conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to cross-validate previously used models and to
investigate new models to measure professionals’ attitudes toward work with suicidal individuals
and to test the longitudinal stability of the models by analyzing new sets of data. The population
in the ﬁrst study consisted of a heterogenous group of 1350 professionals who managed suicidal
individuals relatively frequently. The second study included 640 professionals. The results of the
cross-validation of previous models were described and a new questionnaire measuring attitudes
toward suicide prevention, suicidal individuals, and organizational-facilitated self-efﬁcacy (OSAQ-
12) was presented. The three presented models retained a good ﬁt and were stable over time. Valid","rate in this study is 30%. This group of non-respondents may in some way have deferred from the
studied population. However, in comparison to other similar studies an attrition rate of 30% is very
low [74].In future studies we will test whether the training in suicide prevention that was given to
those who participated in the study presented in this paper had a positive effect on their attitudes
towards work and the possibility to prevent suicidal behavior.
4. Conclusions
Providing suicide preventive education to health-care staff is likely to improving their attitudes
towards the preventability of suicide, improving clarity regarding their role in the care for suicidal
patients, and their general conﬁdence in their suicide preventive activities. These improvements are
likely to contribute to the prevention of suicide in the health care setting.

2. Method
2.1. Participants
In 2007, mandatory training activities in suicide prevention were held in a psychiatric clinic in
the southern region of Stockholm (South Psychiatry Stockholm) with a catchment area corresponding
to 231,000 adults. Prior to the training all mental health-care staff (500 individuals) were invited to
complete a questionnaire with items concerning work with suicidal patients. The training program as
well as the evaluation results will be presented in a separate paper.
The number of participants who completed the questionnaire was 358 (71.6%) of which 38.3%
were males and 61.7% were females and the mean age was 49.96. The participants were of different
medical backgrounds such as psychiatrists (4.8%), doctors under training (3.6%), case managers
(47.9%), contact persons (30.8%) and others such as psychologists, physical therapists and occupational","health care workers), are often used as best-practice
approaches, but lack the conclusive evidence of eﬀec-
tiveness on the outcome measures of reduction in
suicide or suicide attempts. Approaches like cogni-
tive-behavioural therapy or dialectical behaviour ther-
apy may in the present time be too costly and not
feasible
due
to
the
lack
of
trained
personnel.
Community-level strategies that may have potential
in preventing suicide in LMICs include utilizing the
services of nongovernmental organizations, awareness
raising in schools, community education around self-
immolation and training of gatekeepers (Vijayakumar
et al. 2004, 2013; Vijayakumar & Armsom, 2005;
Ahmadi & Ytterstad, 2007; Wasserman et al. 2015;

sive studies to improve the evidence base around
these suggestions in LMICs before they can be recom-
mended for speciﬁc contexts.

the process of consulting stakeholders about a national
response often generates interest and creates an en-
vironment for change. Through the process of creating
the national response, stakeholders become commit-
ted, public dialogue on stigma is encouraged, vulner-
able groups are identiﬁed, research priorities are
ﬁxed, and public and media awareness are increased
to ultimately reach the goal of reducing the suicide
rate in countries. Particularly in countries with limited
resources, the importance of communities and their
support of suicide prevention programmes cannot be
overstated (WHO, 2014a).

the training programme to these in order for the pro-
gramme to be successful within countries and cultures.
Follow-up care and community support following
a suicide attempt
Recently discharged patients often lack social support
and can feel isolated once they leave care. Follow-up
and community support have been eﬀective in reduc-
ing suicide deaths and attempts among patients who
have been recently discharged from the health care sys-
tem (Luxton et al. 2013). Repeated follow-ups are a
recommended low-cost intervention that is easy to im-
plement; existing treatment staﬀ, including trained
non-specialized health workers, can implement the in-
tervention and require few resources (WHO, 2010b).
This is particularly useful in LMICs and also recog-
nized in high-income countries. The intervention can
involve the use of postcards, telephone calls or brief
in-person visits (informal or formal) to make contact","expected to listen and provide emotional support, but not
give advice or practical help. In line with previous findings
on volunteer behavior (e.g., Pollock et al., 2010; Kevoe-

engaged in advice-related activities.
The dataset used in the study included 2,000 chats,
randomly selected from an existing database including
all chats received by the helpline between 2012 and 2016
(approximately 20,000 chats). To avoid an unbalanced
sample, we randomly sampled 20 chats for each year (in
total 100). For the current study, we excluded five chats
with contacts on behalf of someone else. Accordingly, the
analysis was based on 95 chats. In addition to chats, one
of the authors (Iversen) conducted ethnographic re-
search at the helpline, including participating in the
volunteer training and discussing preliminary findings
with experienced volunteers who participated with
written informed consent. The study received ethics","contact the helpline when they need and tell volunteers

of alcohol and substance use disorders in the etiology
of suicidal behaviour has traditionally received much
less attention than that of other types of mental disor-
ders such as depression, but it has become increasingly
evident that alcohol and drugs are important prevent-","texts. The quality and availability of data on suicide
and suicide attempts in many countries, particularly
LMICs, is often limited, thus, identifying evidence-

diﬃcult.

1. Introduction
Measuring attitudes toward suicide and suicide prevention has been an endeavor
of many researchers in the ﬁeld of suicidology since the 1980s. Interventions aiming to
improve attitudes toward suicide prevention are common elements of multi-component
suicide preventive strategies [1,2] as the stigma surrounding suicide in the population could
be a perceived hindrance for preventing suicidal acts. Attitudes toward suicide also play an
important role in the willingness to implement suicide preventive interventions [3], as well
as in facilitating the acceptance and effect of these interventions. Furthermore, the stigma
surrounding suicide might inﬂuence the quality and effectiveness of care and, consequently,","much of what is said about suicide and its causes is still taboo in most contemporary societies and cultures, internet websites and
discussion forums have become an important and controversial source of information on the subject. A great deal of ambivalence
is discernible as to whether online communication about suicide primarily should be seen as an opportunity or a serious threat.
Objective: To investigate how the subject of suicide is represented on the Internet, based on hits generated by the search engine
Google.
Methods: In an exploratory design, Google search results on the target word “suicide”, for the years 2005, 2009, and 2012
respectively, were systematically analyzed and compared.
Results: The study shows that web pages of institutional origin on the subject predominate, that the content provided by these
institutions concerns primarily research and prevention, and that the form of communication used by these senders is almost","on the belief that the distress of a suicidal individual can be counterbalanced by positive attitudes
thus having a preventive effect on suicidal acts [15–21], although there are few studies that have
systematically examined whether improving attitudes lead to an actual decrease in suicides (this is
partly because improved attitudes are, in most cases, the result of increased knowledge, and the suicide
preventive effects of the two are difﬁcult to separate). In fact, the attitude-behavior link is one of the
more controversial topics in the attitudes literature, due to both the complexity of attitudes and the
difﬁculty in linking general attitudes with speciﬁc behaviors [22]. Evaluations of suicide-preventive
training have also shown that the obtained attitude-change was not consistent over time [23–25].
Thus, there are many difﬁculties in using attitudes as an outcome measure in evaluating training","of suicide change.
Responsible media reporting
Inappropriate media reporting practices can sensatio-
nalize and glamourize suicide and increase the risk
of ‘copycat’ suicides (imitation of suicides) among vul-
nerable people. Responsible reporting of suicide in the
media has been shown to decrease suicide rates.
Important aspects of responsible reporting include:
avoiding detailed descriptions of suicidal acts, avoid-
ing sensationalism and glamorization, using respon-
sible
language,
minimizing
the
prominence
and
duration of suicide reports, avoiding oversimpliﬁca-
tions, educating the public about suicide and available
treatments, and providing information on where to
seek help. Media collaboration and participation in
the development, dissemination and training of re-
sponsible reporting practices are also essential for suc-
cessfully improving the reporting of suicide and
reducing
suicide
imitation
(Pirkis,
2009).
These
improvements were demonstrated in Australia and","attitudes and beliefs that were communicated on a forum
before, during and after a suicide act. We undertook two
related analyses: a qualitative investigation of the messages
that were posted before the suicide and a combined
qualitative–quantitative analysis of the messages posted during
and after the suicide. Nearly half the posted messages before
the suicide encouraged the victim to complete the suicidal act,
and a surprising number of posts after the suicide expressed
excitement, although around half of the posts considered the
suicide to be tragic. It is of great importance to increase
awareness of suicide signals and understanding about how
to respond to individuals who communicate suicide
intentions on different forums on the internet.

the audiences. Some studies have also investigated whether media recommendations on responsible
reporting suicide cases have a protective inﬂuence, known as the “papageno effect”, on consumers.
Niederkrotenthaler, Voracek [3] conducted studies that indicate this type of preventive effect. Not
so surprisingly, these types of studies on media-effects in suicide focus mainly on media reporting a
suicide-speciﬁc theme. However, the suicide-related effects of more general media consumption, such
as reading books or watching ﬁlms with non-speciﬁc themes, are largely unknown.
Protective factors are less often the focus of research on youth suicides compared to risk factors.

to the substantial amount of pro-suicide messages on the Internet

resources should also be developed using the dialogic
communication between the mental-health expertise and
help-seeking individuals; unidirectional information about
mental illness and suicide prevention is not enough [43].

3.1. The First Study
3.1.1. Cross-Validations
Conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to cross-validate three measure-
ment models that were previously found to meet the criteria for good ﬁtting models in
psychiatric populations (see [14]), Job clarity, Job conﬁdence, and Attitudes towards pre-
vention. The cross-validations were performed on the total sample of 1350 respondents
that had reported working with suicidal individuals during the past six months.
3.1.2. Tests of the Hypothesized Measurement Models
To test the hypothesized measurement models of Job support and Attitudes toward
suicidal persons, the N = 1350 respondents that had reported working with suicidal
individuals during the past six months were randomly allocated into two test groups
(Group G1: n = 698; Group G2: n = 652). G1 was used to explore the data with Exploratory","with suicidal patients and suicide prevention. In 2007, 500 health-care staff working in a psychiatric
clinic in Stockholm received a questionnaire with items concerning work with suicidal patients to
which 358 (71.6%) responded. A set of attitude items were tested using structural equation modelling
(LISREL). Three models were found to be satisfactory valid and reliable: Job clarity, Job conﬁdence and
Attitudes towards prevention. These were then used in regression analyses as dependent variables with
predictors such as experience of work with suicidal patients, perceived sufﬁcient training, age and gender.
Perceived sufﬁcient training was consistently the most important predictor for all three attitude concepts
(p < 0.01, β = 0.559 for Job clarity; p < 0.01, β = 0.53 for Job conﬁdence; p < 0.01, β = 0.191 for Attitudes
towards prevention). Age was another signiﬁcant predictor for Job clarity (p < 0.05, β = 0.134), as was","therapists (12.9%). The case-managers were mainly psychiatric nurses with additional academic
training in case management and the contact persons, mainly assistant nurses, with at least upper
secondary school education speciﬁcally related to healthcare.
2.2. Data Analysis
2.2.1. Outcome Variables
There were three different dependent variables in this study.
Job clarity was measured by
4 items [57,58] relating to subjects’ perception of whether they understood their tasks regarding
work with suicidal patients. Job conﬁdence was also measured by four items concerning subjects’
conﬁdence regarding work with suicidal patients. Attitudes towards prevention constituted 4 items
inquiring about subjects’ perception on whether suicide is preventable [49]. The four item scales were
aggregated for the main analyses. These models were used in the regression.

Due to various problems related to the validity and reliability of
commonly used scales, there is a lack of overall agreement on how to measure these attitudes.
Conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to cross-validate previously used models and to
investigate new models to measure professionals’ attitudes toward work with suicidal individuals
and to test the longitudinal stability of the models by analyzing new sets of data. The population
in the ﬁrst study consisted of a heterogenous group of 1350 professionals who managed suicidal
individuals relatively frequently. The second study included 640 professionals. The results of the
cross-validation of previous models were described and a new questionnaire measuring attitudes
toward suicide prevention, suicidal individuals, and organizational-facilitated self-efﬁcacy (OSAQ-
12) was presented. The three presented models retained a good ﬁt and were stable over time. Valid","and reliability differed among items.
Both the models for Attitudes toward suicidal persons and the model for Organization-
facilitated self-efﬁcacy continued to retain a good overall and local ﬁt when they were
tested on the population in the follow-up study.
6.3. Summary and Scale Development
Three good-ﬁtting measurement models, which were valid and reliable over time,
were found when they were analyzed with CFA on a heterogenous sample of individuals,
whose unifying characteristic was their exposure to suicidal individuals during the past
six months. These models measure attitudes toward prevention, attitudes toward suicidal
persons, and organizational-facilitated self-efﬁcacy. The ﬁnal questionnaire and its included
items are presented below (Table 7).
The responses to all items were scored using a Likert scale with values of 1 (do not
agree at all), 2 (hardly agree), 3 (almost agree), and 4 (agree completely).","with suicidal patients and suicide prevention. In 2007, 500 health-care staff working in a psychiatric

The scale is also limited by its factor structure. Each of the three factors (constructs)
is unidimensional and comprises exactly four items each, which is the minimum for an
overidentiﬁed model [28]. It would be interesting, in future research, to see if it is possible
to supplement the models with more items and to ﬁnd new models that measure other
aspects of work with suicidal persons.
Another limitation regarding our interpretation is that although the three measure-
ment models were found to be good ﬁts over time, they might not be good ﬁts across
groups. Unfortunately, this has not been possible to analyze in the present study, due to the
large variation in gender and in the number of respondents from each professional group.

be integrated in research and health and social care processes

improve public health and wellbeing is a another area of growing
interest to researchers and policy makers (70, 71). A considerable
number of suicides occur in people who have not received any
prior mental health assessment or treatment (72). Reliable suicide
detection from data generated outside of the healthcare setting is
one way of addressing this issue. For instance, moderated online
social media-based therapy has been successfully developed for

research protocols in place (74), this approach could serve as
inspiration for developing moderated intervention programmes","In one study, performed over a 11-month period, the results illustrated that the discussion members

Preventing suicides on a national or even international scale
requires multiple societal and health care service considerations
(64, 65). To incorporate new technological support that
may aid clinicians in their daily work, data-driven methods
need to be developed in a way that they actually provide
actionable and interpretable information. The main advantages
of risk assessment tools in clinical practice are that they
are standardized, easy to administer, learn, and interpret—but
because they oﬀer little or no predictive ability, they could be

better reﬂect the individual patient situation (Figure 1).

Introduction
Depressive disorders are the leading cause of disability
worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of 4¢4%
(322 million individuals), of which 12% (40 million
individuals) are in Europe.1 Compared to the normal
population, the risk of developing depression is higher
in individuals with a wide range of somatic, i.e., physi-
cal, conditions. A few such examples are endometriosis
and abdominal pain, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, breast
cancer, myocardial infarction (MI), lower limb amputa-
tion, and kidney failure.2−6 The emergence of depres-
sion in so many heterogeneous somatic conditions is
likely due to the reduced quality of life and limitations
these conditions entail. However, depression itself has","Depression and anxiety after acute myocardial infarction treated by primary

both, or all, will commit suicide together, in a prearranged place and at a designated time [59]. 
Research concerning the Internet and suicidal behaviour, in this aspect, investigates what is known as 
“net suicides”, i.e., suicide pacts made on the Internet [60]. 
Evidence shows that suicide pacts often develop in chat rooms or on message boards, which 
endorse suicidal behaviours [49]. This milieu attracts vulnerable persons feeling socially excluded 
from society [60]. The socially-isolated individual can communicate interactively and anonymously, 
thus, exposing him/herself to impending pro-suicidal incitement from one or more parties involved. 
This could potentially lead to the coordination of a suicide pact."

Suicide is a common and serious health problem in railway settings. 
In the European Union, between 2200 and 2700 suicides occur every

struck by a train), which account for approximately 85% of all deaths in 
the rail bound system. Suicides in the railway and metro system account 
for 6% of all suicides in Sweden. In addition to suicides, there are also on

(Ceccato et al., 2021). 
There are different measures, with varying levels of evidence, aimed 
at preventing trespassing and/or suicides in the railway system. The 
most researched measure is the complete restriction of access to the 
tracks by the use of platform screen doors (PSD) (Chung et al., 2016; Law 
et al., 2009; Ueda et al., 2015; Xing et al., 2019). However, PSD is an 
expensive intervention that is often unfeasible or difficult to implement 
at long platforms or during the use of different train models. To coun­
teract this problem, a toolbox of different, more scalable, measures are 
being developed within the Restrail project. The toolbox includes 
measures evaluated by peer-reviewed research, as well as those that 
have been investigated by infrastructure owners (Restrail Toolbox, 
2022). Despite this effort, there is still a need to continue research 
regarding the prevention of railway suicides (Mishara & Bardon, 2016)."

Risky practices and exposure to harm begin early in 
a young person’s life today, requiring new approaches 
and strategies across sectors. Today’s children and 
adolescents face growing challenges and threats: inju­

further increase vulnerabilities.
Reducing the burden of major diseases such as

1. Introduction 
Suicide is a common and serious health problem in railway settings. 
In the European Union, between 2200 and 2700 suicides occur every 
year on the railways and suicides cause about three times more deaths 
than other accidents (Eurostat, 2022). In the Swedish railway and metro 
system there are about 85 suicides per year due to “person under train” 
incidents (henceforth refered to as “PUT,” an event when a person is 
struck by a train), which account for approximately 85% of all deaths in 
the rail bound system. Suicides in the railway and metro system account 
for 6% of all suicides in Sweden. In addition to suicides, there are also on 
average 10 PUT incidents due to suicide attempts per year, and 
furthermore, about 500 other suicide related cases per year require the 
involvement of first responders (e.g. police, firefighters; Fredin-Knutz´
en, 
Andersson, Hadlaczky, & Sokolowski, 2020)."

Suicide is a global public health concern, with more than 800,000 worldwide deaths, annually. The
World Health Organization has set a global target to reduce the rates of suicides by 10% by 2020
(1, 2) The concept of suicidal behavior encapsulates thoughts, plans and acts an individual makes

For targeted suicide prevention strategies to be eﬀective for those with mental health problems,
high-quality and accessible data from health services is essential (1). With the increased availability
of electronic data from public health services and patient-generated data online, advances in data-
driven methods could transform the ways in which psychiatric health services are provided (4–6).","symptoms in childhood and the comorbid presence of these symptoms could be associated with
concurrent and long-term impairment [45], the topic of this papers is a critically important health
problem. Therefore, the practical implications of the current study are that clinicians routinely and
repeatedly have to screen, assess and properly treat the symptoms of anxiety in patients with chronic
physical illness. The clinicians’ focus on both conditions could be important to develop appropriate,
targeted interventions and may increase the likelihood of improved outcomes. Based on our ﬁndings
we emphasize that adolescents with physical and psychiatric symptoms—even on the subthreshold
level—require evaluation of functional impairment, self-rated health and subjective well-being as it is
essential for secondary prevention.","Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2018, 15, 1698

illnesses or with physical disability.
Additionally, both of having a chronic illness or a physical disability was related to a signiﬁcantly
higher level of anxiety, which was associated with signiﬁcantly lower level of well-being. Furthermore,
we found that the level of anxiety mediated the relationship between self-reported impairment

between countries, ranging from 4.1% to 23.5% [6]. Among youths who have previously attempted 
suicide, 24% attempt suicide again within the following year [7]. In addition to suicide and suicide 
attempts suicidal ideation (SI) and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) levels also appear to be elevated. 
Like in the case of attempts, there are considerable variations in the standardized prevalence of suicidal 
ideation among the general population in Europe, ranging from 1.1% to 19.8% [8]. From a global 
view, the estimated prevalence of suicide attempts, plans and ideation ranged from 0.4%–4.2%;  
1.1%–15.6%; to 2.6%–25.4%, respectively [9]. The annual prevalence of NSSI is estimated to be 
around 7%, with lifetime rates between 12–13% [10]. NSSI rates appear to be higher among females 
than males [11]."

making (23), and involves making a number of choices between 
four different decks of cards. Two of the decks are disadvanta-
geous, as they entail large wins, but even larger losses, leading to 
a net loss. The losses and gains in the other two decks are smaller, 
but lead to a larger net profit in the long run. After sampling 
a few cards, healthy participants usually end up favoring the 
advantageous decks, while participants with for instance frontal 
cortex lesions underperform by selecting more cards from the 
high-risk decks (23–25). In the study of Jollant and colleagues 
(22), mood disorder patients with a history of suicide attempt 
performed significantly worse, both when compared to healthy 
controls and compared to mood disorder patients without a his-
tory of suicide attempts. In subsequent IGT studies, decreased 
performance was also found in bipolar patients with a history","discomforts due to their chronic illnesses lower or do not lower their daily abilities somewhat/certainly.
Additionally, we found that there were signiﬁcant differences already in the level of subthreshold
anxiety with small effect size between those who: (a) suffered or didn’t suffer from chronic illness,
(b) described their state of health poor/very poor and good/very good, and (c) reported that the
discomforts due to their chronic illnesses lower or do not lower their daily abilities somewhat/certainly.
All these data show that in the case of physical illnesses and poor self-rated health physicians have to
screen the symptoms of anxiety already in a subthreshold level. The data in this paper supports
previous studies, which underline the role of comorbidity of anxiety with psychical symptoms
in adolescents [1–7]. Moreover, the current study highlights the importance of recognition and
appropriate intervention already for subthreshold anxiety in adolescents with physical disorders","activity also determine the way adolescents perceive and
evaluate their own behaviour [13]. While sexual behav-
iours may directly lead to physical health outcomes, it is
their perception that arguably mediates outcomes in the
mental and social health domains [13]. In view of this
complexity, a broader perspective on adolescents’ sexual
experiences taking into account other facets of their
wellbeing, such as mental health, would be desirable in
Europe. It would also be important to study whether other
psychopathology manifestations beyond depression are
associated with early sexual initiation and risk-taking,
although that would clearly require more substantial re-
search efforts. This study took advantage of comprehen-
sive information about the health and wellbeing of more
than 12,000 European adolescents, which was gathered by
a recent EU-funded project called SEYLE (Saving and
Empowering Young Lives in Europe) [22, 23]. We aimed

Results: The path analysis was conducted among 100 patients with breast and prostate cancer, with 66% (n=66) being female
and 81% (n=81) having a college education. Patients reported good mental health scores, with low levels of depression and stress
at baseline. System use was approximately 6 days in the initial 2 weeks and 45 days over the 12-week study period. The results
revealed that PU was the strongest predictor of system use at 12 weeks (βuse at 12 weeks is predicted by PU at 12 weeks=.384), whereas system
use at 2 weeks moderately predicted system use at 12 weeks (βuse at 12 weeks is predicted by use at 2 weeks=.239). Notably, there were
uncertain associations between baseline variables (education, sex, and mental health symptoms) and system use at 2 weeks,
indicating a need for better predictors for early system use.

and in January 2012, in order to investigate possible changes
in the representation of suicide on the Internet over time.
One aspect that could be argued to influence the results of this
study is changes in search engine algorithms used by Google.
Such algorithms are optimized by Google frequently to enhance
user experience. Changes in these algorithms may affect the
search results in a way that does not reflect a change in tangible
suicide-related material on the Internet. However, as the aim of
this study is to capture what Internet users find on the web, as
opposed to describing the complete range of suicide-related
materials on the Internet (including those that cannot be found),
it is argued that the representativeness of this sample is not
threatened: A change in the algorithms affects the results of this
study the same way as it affects the results as experienced by
users."

concurrent and long-term impairment [45], the topic of this papers is a critically important health
problem. Therefore, the practical implications of the current study are that clinicians routinely and
repeatedly have to screen, assess and properly treat the symptoms of anxiety in patients with chronic
physical illness. The clinicians’ focus on both conditions could be important to develop appropriate,
targeted interventions and may increase the likelihood of improved outcomes. Based on our ﬁndings
we emphasize that adolescents with physical and psychiatric symptoms—even on the subthreshold
level—require evaluation of functional impairment, self-rated health and subjective well-being as it is
essential for secondary prevention.","across continents [62]. In Japan, during 2008, there was a sudden increase in hydrogen sulphide 
poisoning, which developed as a potential method for committing suicide. This was eventually linked 
to a website that disseminated material on a new technique for manufacturing gas, which was then 
transmitted through message boards on the Internet. As the trend rapidly spread through Internet 
communication, the new suicide method began emerging in other parts of the world [63].  
In contrast to the potential risks of cyber technology, there is a clear advantage to having the ability 
to quickly access information and to interactively communicate with individuals in real-time, while 
maintaining anonymity. This Internet pathway has significant potential for promoting prevention 
efforts and reaching vulnerable risk-groups.","only. Sensitive data was not collected, and all participant responses were de-identiﬁed, thus no ethical

out of 26 were aware of HiAP, five reported its impact on their work,
five had only heard about it, and 13 did not recognize it at all.
Agenda 2030 and HiAP are intended to be highly relevant for public
health and health equity. This was, however, not reflected in the in-
terviews. Even though most informants were aware of Agenda 2030,
the impact sometimes seemed to be modest.
Yes, I think it [Agenda 2030] is a very good thing. I believe that it could
contribute to breaking down the silos and making those working at the
ministerial level to look more broadly at things. Because it's quite im-
portant.
At the moment we are not very strongly connecting it [Agenda 2030]. We
are aware of it, and our ministry has certain responsibilities in it, but it
hasn't really been implemented very closely with our national policy-

by reducing parental smoking, reducing outdoor air pollution and having the mother take folate supplements

Such algorithms are optimized by Google frequently to enhance
user experience. Changes in these algorithms may affect the
search results in a way that does not reflect a change in tangible
suicide-related material on the Internet. However, as the aim of
this study is to capture what Internet users find on the web, as
opposed to describing the complete range of suicide-related

Results: The path analysis was conducted among 100 patients with breast and prostate cancer, with 66% (n=66) being female
and 81% (n=81) having a college education. Patients reported good mental health scores, with low levels of depression and stress
at baseline. System use was approximately 6 days in the initial 2 weeks and 45 days over the 12-week study period. The results
revealed that PU was the strongest predictor of system use at 12 weeks (βuse at 12 weeks is predicted by PU at 12 weeks=.384), whereas system
use at 2 weeks moderately predicted system use at 12 weeks (βuse at 12 weeks is predicted by use at 2 weeks=.239). Notably, there were
uncertain associations between baseline variables (education, sex, and mental health symptoms) and system use at 2 weeks,
indicating a need for better predictors for early system use.

Additionally, we found that there were signiﬁcant differences already in the level of subthreshold
anxiety with small effect size between those who: (a) suffered or didn’t suffer from chronic illness,
(b) described their state of health poor/very poor and good/very good, and (c) reported that the
discomforts due to their chronic illnesses lower or do not lower their daily abilities somewhat/certainly.
All these data show that in the case of physical illnesses and poor self-rated health physicians have to
screen the symptoms of anxiety already in a subthreshold level. The data in this paper supports
previous studies, which underline the role of comorbidity of anxiety with psychical symptoms
in adolescents [1–7]. Moreover, the current study highlights the importance of recognition and
appropriate intervention already for subthreshold anxiety in adolescents with physical disorders","showing a broad range of use volumes among participants.

Source of Prior Information
The following section describes how previous research was
used to inform some of the prior parameters included in the
Bayesian SEM. The literature search yielded 1641 articles. After
reviewing based on titles and abstracts, 99.21% (1628/1641) of
the articles were excluded. A total of 12 articles were included
for full screening. Of the 12 articles, 2 (17%) were removed
owing to the qualitative nature of the method and the focus of
the topics and 1 (8%) focused on the older adult population","can experience a sense of relationship and community. For those
trying to establish suicide pacts on the internet, dying together
seems more comforting than dying alone. When the TS chooses
to ‘share’ his suicide with the other participants, it can be
interpreted as a final attempt to break the social isolation and
loneliness, although it may seem contradictory.
A suicide is not just about dying. A suicide also communicates
something to the world around the person, such as that the person
feels unloved and outcast. The suicidal person achieves something
with the act, something that the recipients cannot escape. It is a
way to regulate the social environment.40 The suicidal act can
be seen as a powerless person’s weapon to influence the outside
world in a way in which the recipients are deprived of the ability
to speak back, which is a fundamental point.
During and after the suicide
The analysis of the messages that were posted after the suicide","the transcriptions were given to the re-coder as a basis for re-coding. The
inter-coding agreement between the two coders was initially 78% and
after discussion 95%. No further re-coding was performed.

The results from the interviews are presented in the following four
sections: 1) The impact of international policy documents, 2) The extent
of health equity-promoting measures, 3) The extent of cooperation
between ministries, and 4) Qualitative aspects of cooperation between
ministries.

This was true of smoking prevention programmes, availability of
cessation support, and the sanctions for violations. The outcome
variables were heterogeneous, and the age range between studies
was variable. Since age is a major determinant of the prevalence
of tobacco use, with a doubling of the initiation rates between
early and middle adolescence (DiFranza 2007), discrepancies
between studies should always be interpreted with respect to age
distribution. With regard to analysis methods, some studies did not
mention any adjustment for potential confounders (Clarke 1994;
Darling 2006; Sinha 2004b; Wiium 2011b) and in general there is
large variability in the factors considered for adjustment.

is still missing, namely how those who are working with suicidal patients perceive that they are
supported by the organization.
Although several international as well as Swedish studies have shown that attitudes can be
changed through training in suicide prevention [34,36,37,39–41,43,48,53–55] they are also considered
as being relatively stable [30,56], age or predispositions such as gender may have an important effect
on attitudes, alongside prior experience of dealing with suicidal persons, as attitudes are expected to
change as a function of experience.
The aim of this study is to investigate what impact age, gender, the experience of working with
suicidal patients and the perceived level of training in suicide prevention have on attitudes towards
the preventability of suicide and working with suicidal patients.","74. Hall, R.C.; Platt, D.E. Suicide risk assessment: A review of risk factors for suicide in 100 patients

Although these large databases have made increasing
strides to standardize indicator definitions, data sources,
and collection methodology, inherently, there will be differ-
ences between some countries that limit comparability.
Additionally, not all policies and outcomes of interest were

making comparability more challenging for some indica-
tors. Due to these limitations, we attempted to choose
indicators with objective or widely recognized definitions.
Additionally, some data points were missing as statistics
were either not publicly available or not collected. Although
this was most readily apparent for Cuba, we elected to in-
clude the data available, with cautionary notes on interpret-
ation, as Cuba’s successes in some areas of early child
health and development may serve as case studies for other

reporting sleep-related consequences of screen use, even when screen time, screen content
and other control variables were held constant. Evidence from meta-analyses corroborate
the importance of sleep in the context of screen time, although some studies have suggested
that younger children are more susceptible to screen-related sleep problems [30], while
other studies have suggested that screen time impacts mental health more severely in
adolescents than younger children [11]. Age-related effects might be related to neurophysi-
ological development during certain life phases, and higher sensitivity to sleep problems
might confer health risks proportional to the extent that sleep inﬂuences mental health [30].
Therefore, the possibility to generalize ﬁndings across different age groups might be limited

adult and adolescent populations [46]. A longitudinal study of adolescents found that late
chronotype is associated with future risk of diagnosis of depression and increases in depressive
symptoms, but the relationship seems bi-directional [47]. Several possible mechanisms may
explain this relationship, including societal factors such as early school start times, that prevent
late chronotypes from sleeping enough and thus increase their risk for adverse outcomes. Also,
psychological factors (i.e., rumination in the evening), biological factors (i.e., gene variations
associated with both circadian rhythm and mood), and light exposure (which may be reduced
in depressed individuals and has an impact on the circadian rhythm) could explain the rela-
tionship between chronotype and depression [48].

Finally, it is possible that the sleep behaviors and perceived quality of sleep in the study sam-
ple were influenced by seasonality, that is during which month of the year data were collected.
Future studies may be warranted to explore these effects.
Conclusions
The results of this study build on existing evidence about insufficient sleep (and sleep opportu-
nities) among adolescents. The study shows that a substantial proportion of Swedish adoles-
cents is affected by short sleep duration, which could probably be prevented. This study also
contributes to evidence about the relationship between sleep problems/behaviors and depres-
sion in this age group, showing that both short weekday sleep duration, poor sleep quality, and
late chronotype are associated with increased odds of depression.

Associations between sleep habits, quality, chronotype and depression in adolescents","in suicide attempts. In our study, we show the involvement of loss aversion in particular, 
and propose that individuals high in loss aversion are discouraged from carrying out the 
suicide attempt because of a greater focus on the negative consequences of the decision.
