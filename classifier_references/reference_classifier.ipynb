The questionnaire included items about sexual initiation and reproductive health risk factors, such as number of sexual partners, frequency of condom use, and pregnancy involvement. Psychopathology was evaluated with validated instruments and/or ad-hoc questions. Results: Of 11,406 respondents (median age 15; interquartile range [IQR] 14–15; 57% females), 18.8% reported sexual initiation. Sixty percent of them also reported at least one reproductive risk factor. Sexual initiation was significantly more common among pupils older than 15 years (38% versus 13.2% younger pupils) and males (21.3% versus 16.9% females). It was also more common among pupils with depression (age/sex-adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.871), anxiety (aOR 2.190), severe suicidal ideation (aOR 2.259), self-injurious behaviour (aOR 2.892), and suicide attempts (aOR 3.091). These associations were particularly strong among pupils ≤15 years old and, for overt psychopathology, among pupils with low non-sexual risk behaviour profile and females. Depression (aOR 1.937), anxiety (aOR 2.282), severe suicidal ideation (aOR 2.354), self-injurious behaviour (aOR 3.022), and suicide attempts (aOR 3.284) were associated with higher reproductive health risk, defined by an increasing number of coexisting reproductive risk factors. Conclusions: These findings suggest an alignment between mental and reproductive health risk and support the value of cross-domain collaboration in adolescent health. The association between psychopathology and reproductive health risk, as well as its variations with age, sex, and associated risk behaviours, should be considered when designing health-promoting or disease-preventing interventions for adolescents.\n",

Le questionnaire comprenait des questions relatives à l’initiation de la vie sexuelle et aux facteurs de risque liés à la santé de la reproduction, tels que le nombre de partenaires sexuels, la fréquence de l’utilisation de préservatifs, la survenue de grossesses. Les données psychopathologiques ont été évaluées à l’aide d’instruments validés et/ou de questions spécifiques. Résultats: Parmi les 11.406 élèves ayant répondu ( âge moyen 15 ans, gamme interquartile ▪IQR▪ 14-15 ; 57% de femmes), 18,8% avaient initié une vie sexuelle. Soixante pour cent d’entre eux mentionnaient au moins un facteur de risque reproductif. L’initiation sexuelle était significativement plus fréquente parmi les élèves âgés de plus de 15 ans (38% vs 13,2%, chez les plus jeunes), chez les garçons (21,3% vs 16,9% chez les filles).

            "Background Adolescence is a unique period of human life characterized by dramatic development, which includes reproduction-re- lated changes and, often, sexual initiation. Developing sexu- ality is physiologic during adolescence, but early debut implies a risk for immediate or future adverse reproductive health outcomes, such as unwanted teenage pregnancies and their consequences [1, 2]. Unsafe sexual practices ex- pose to the risk of sexually transmitted infections, which can also have repercussions on future health and fertility [3–6]. Women who had sexual debut before the age of 15, more often report gaps in contraceptive use, sex-partner concurrency, and serial monogamy later in life [4, 7, 8]. Apart from reproductive health risk outcomes, early sexual initiation is associated with non-sexual risk behaviours (e.g. smoking or substance abuse), context vulnerabilities (e.g. bullying, truancy and low parental involvement) and psychological difficulties [9], which are not uncommon among girls and boys [10].\n",

            "While reproductive and mental health are acknowledged key aspects of European adolescents’ current and future wellbeing [11], both appear to be neglected in terms of systematic data collection and research in Europe. Many studies focus on health outcomes belonging to one specific domain (e.g. reproductive or mental), but likely interrela- tionships between different aspects of adolescent health are still poorly studied hence overlooked by ad-hoc policies [12]. However, the potential outcomes of adolescent sexual behaviours are obviously not only physical but also mental and social [13]. An association between early sexual initi- ation and psychopathology manifestations such as depres- sion has been reported by studies that mostly proceed from the USA [5, 14–17], whereas fewer similar findings are available from European countries [18, 19]. Although there is evidence that early sexual debut may lead to adverse mental health outcomes [17], depression has also been ob- served to precede and predict sexual initiation, multiple partners and inconsistent condom use among adolescents [5, 16, 18]. Other longitudinal studies have found that men- tal health problems predict poor compliance to prescribed contraception [20] and depressive symptoms are associated with an increased risk of unintended pregnancies [21].\n",

            "The complex and likely bidirectional relationship be- tween mental health and sexual behaviours is consistent with the conceptual view that factors influencing sexual activity also determine the way adolescents perceive and evaluate their own behaviour [13].

In view of this complexity, a broader perspective on adolescents’ sexual experiences taking into account other facets of their wellbeing, such as mental health, would be desirable in Europe. It would also be important to study whether other psychopathology manifestations beyond depression are associated with early sexual initiation and risk-taking, although that would clearly require more substantial re- search efforts. This study took advantage of comprehen- sive information about the health and wellbeing of more than 12,000 European adolescents, which was gathered by a recent EU-funded project called SEYLE (Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe) [22, 23]. We aimed at evaluating whether pupils with psychopathology manifestations, such as depression, anxiety, self-injurious behaviour and suicidality, are more likely to have a higher reproductive health risk, defined by earlier sexual initiation and associated risk factors. A secondary objective was to verify whether the strength of the association between psy- chopathology and sexual initiation is modified by age, sex or the co-occurrence of non-sexual risk behaviours.\n",

This population consisted of young females (55.2%) and males (44.8%) attending 179 schools in 11 countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain. Karolinska Institutet, Sweden, acted as scientific coordinating centre, and the Child Psychiatric Epidemiology Group at Columbia University and New York State Psychiatric Institute partici- pated as methodology experts. The two core objectives of SEYLE were to gather epidemiological data about European adolescent health and wellbeing, and to actively test suicide- preventive interventions in a randomized controlled trial [24]. The included schools were randomly selected out of a list of eligible schools located within the study sites of each country, according to the selection criteria described by Wasserman et al. [22]. A 67.8% response rate was obtained from the selected schools. Elsewhere published analyses show that SEYLE’s study sites were representative of each respective national population, based on none or small significant differences with the respective country in several key parameters, including age, sex distribution, proportion of 15-year old males and females, net income, immigrants and unemployment rates [23].

SEYLE’s questionnaire investigated sexual reproductive risk factors (RRF), that were included in ana- lysis as dichotomous variables: number of sexual partners (dichotomized as 1 versus ≥2); use of condom (dichoto- mized as “rarely or never” versus “always or almost all the time”); pregnancy involvement (yes or no). For each study subject, an additional outcome variable called “reproductive health risk” was computed by subcategorizing the outcome sexual initiation depending on associated risk factors (no initiation; initiation without RRF; initiation and 1 RRF; initi- ation and 2 or 3 RRF).\n",

When official validated versions were unavailable in the required language, the surveys were translated, back-translated, and linguistically adapted. In- ternal reliability of psychometric scales was confirmed by a consistently high Cronbach’s alpha [23]. Dichotomous psychopathology variables were computed for each study subject. Anxiety and depression were respectively defined by a Z-SAS score ≥ 45 and a modified BDI-II score ≥ 17. Self-injurious behaviour was defined by a sum of ≥3 obtained adding all points of the modified DSHI [10]. Severe suicide ideation was defined as having seriously considered taking one’s own life, or having made plans about that, at least sometimes during the previous two weeks (4th item of the PSS) [24]. Self-reported suicide attempts were investigated by means of a multiple choice closed-ended question (“Have you ever tried to take your own life?”; possible answers: yes, during the past 2 weeks; yes, during the past 6 months or longer; no, never) and recoded as a dichotomous variable (yes or no).\n",

The idea of early sexual debut as a gateway to sexual and repro- ductive risk has commonly informed responses directed to avoiding or postponing sexual activity, or to minimizing risks through specific education and care. However, the timing of sexual initiation alone may not be considered as an independent marker of risk, as risky sexual activity is often associated with non-sexual risk behaviours (e.g. sub- stance abuse) [3, 9, 34, 35], exposure to childhood trauma [9, 34, 36] or problematic social interactions (e.g. with peers, school or family) [9, 34].

However, such interpretation overlooks the fact that adolescents often cluster on multiple risk behaviours, which leads to inef- fective surveillance and responses [12]. An alternative or complementary interpretation may be informed by a be- havioural risk syndrome model, which frames adolescent risk-taking in the context of broader correlates, such as in- dividual and social vulnerabilities [12, 38–40]. Therefore, our initial hypothesis that adolescent psychopathology could be associated with early/risky sexual activity ap- peared to be well grounded. Nevertheless, most related observations proceed from the USA and focus on de- pression [5, 15–17, 41, 42], whereas less studies have considered young Europeans [18, 19] or other psycho- pathology manifestations such as suicidality [14, 19].\n",

Another peculiarity of this study is that it considered factors that, by altering the strength of the association between psychopathology and sexual initiation, may inform our interpretation. The stronger association among those who report sexual debut by the age of 15 is arguably explained by the fact that sexual activity is less normative at younger age. It therefore occurs more often among vulnerable adolescents, who also engage in other risk behaviours and are exposed to worse health outcomes during adolescence and adult life.

In the absence of psychopathology, the higher prevalence of sexual initiation among pupils en- gaging in multiple non-sexual risk behaviours may relate to gateway mechanisms (e.g. non-sexual behaviours as facilitators to risky sex) and is consistent with the known clustering of risk behaviours among undercontrolling adolescents with conduct and hyperactivity (i.e. externaliz- ing) problems [10, 44]. On the contrary, sexual initiation was most commonly reported by pupils with psychopath- independently of their non-sexual risk behaviour ology, profile. Therefore, internalizing symptoms, such as the ones captured by this study, may play a specific role when it comes to sexual behaviours, and the possibility of a bidirec- tional relationship should be acknowledged. Altogether, these findings explain why targeting individual risk behav- iours without addressing underlying vulnerabilities, such as poor mental health, may be an ineffective way to promote adolescent well-being.\n",

Regarding the study methodology, a cross-sectional design does not allow for inferences about directionality or causality. A further consideration needs to be made regarding the study variables, which were obtained through self-report. Diagnostic interviews would allow for a more correct classification of psychiatric disorders, but they may be unfeasible in the context of a large study as well as they may underestimate symptoms. Self-report of risk or sexual behaviours may be biased by social pres- sure, although SEYLE participants were made aware about the strictly confidential procedures and anonym- ous data management and analysis. Respondents may have variably interpreted what “sexual intercourse” is, as no distinction between different sexual activities was made in the survey. Besides, our choice of reproductive health risk variables was restricted to those available in SEYLE’s questionnaire, while it would have been interest- ing to collect additional data, such as about contraceptive use, sexual orientation, gender identity, or exposure to sex-related trauma. Finally, SEYLE did not collect individ- ual data about the age of sexual debut nor about pubertal timing, which may be a correlate of adolescent sexual experiences.\n",

Not all SEYLE participants could be included because of missing data regarding the repro- ductive health outcome measures. The amount of excluded participants was however very low, as 92% were eventually included. Additionally, the response rates to the psycho- pathology measurements were consistently very high (97– 99%). In terms of generalizability, the samples recruited at the eleven study sites were population-based and fairly representative at national level [23], though it should be acknowledged that Europe is a wide and heterogeneous geopolitical area.

            "Despite those considerations, a number of implications for further research and practice may be suggested by this large and multinational study. It would be interest- ing to test our findings in longitudinal studies, as insights about the directionality of the relationship between psy- chopathology and reproductive health risk are needed to verify how much policy responses may rely on gateway models [12]. However, establishing directionality does not prove causality nor it ensures that interventions on the presumed gateway would have downstream effects on the outcome. Besides, the possibility of reverse or bidirectional relationships should be considered.\n",

            "As a matter of fact, psychological vulnerabilities are possibly one of the numerous determinants of adolescents’ sexual behaviours and their self-evaluation, which is then mediating mental and social health outcomes [13]. A com- prehensive view on those factors would help us under- standing why physiologic events such as sexual debut and developing sexuality sometimes deviate from being posi- tive experiences, as they instead could and should be [13]. Instead of addressing adolescent sexual behaviours only in view of their potential negative outcomes on physical health, it should therefore be acknowledged that coexist- ing problems in different domains of adolescent wellbeing may constitute different manifestations of a more complex behavioural risk syndrome [12], which entails also social and contextual family affluence factors. For instance, appears to be related to adolescent sexual behaviours, although the extent and direction of that association is un- clear [43]. On a related note, a very recent study shows that depression generally increases the risk of unintended pregnancy among young American women although this does not apply to those who are white or have a higher so- cioeconomic status [21]. From a behavioural risk syn- drome perspective, is reductive to abstract each relationship from the whole picture whereas it would be interesting to look into broader correlates of adoles- cent health and risk behaviours [12]. The disparities be- tween adolescent males and their cross-national variation, would be another interesting topic for further research. In fact, while boys are in general more likely than girls to report having had intercourse by the age of 15, that disparity is not ob- servable in all countries or regions [43]. Besides, it would be interesting to study the relationship between psychopathology and sexual behaviours separately for girls and boys, as they cluster on different risk taking profiles [10].\n",

            "Adolescent health practitioners need to be aware of the possibility that reproductive health risk is overrepre- sented among adolescents with psychopathology. This knowledge may be a useful tool for the early identification of young people who are exposed to specific risk or in need of tailored interventions [39]. Broad surveillance and com- prehensive policies should also take into account the limita- tions of gateway effect interpretations and the diversity between boys and girls, who are particularly vulnerable because of the obvious peculiarities of female reproductive health outcomes. Possible interactions between key do- mains of European adolescents’ wellbeing have often been neglected [11, 12, 45]. However, clustering and cor- relates of their risk behaviours are cross-nationally con- sistent [40] and it is recognized that effective adolescent health strategies require intersectoral and multicompo- nent actions [37].

This is particularly evident in case of more overt manifestations, such as self-injury and suicid- ality. Besides, the association between psychopathology and sexual initiation is particularly strong among pupils ≤15 years old and, for overt psychopathology, among pupils with low non-sexual risk behaviour profile or fe- males. These findings should be taken into account when tailoring health-promoting or disease-preventing interven- tions for adolescents.\n",
